--First functions for Haskalculus. I'm going to try to create my own version of what is on this guy Ben Kovach's math and programming
--blog. I haven't had my Calculus maths yet, but I'm pretty sure he's taking a derivative. d divided by the product of 
--itself and x (the derivative?), of f of x, equals the limit as h approaches zero of f of the sum of x and h less f of x, divided by 
--h.

--How do we program that bad boy?

--Ben approximates the derivative by substituting a small decimal number for h instead of calculating the limit of the function
--as it goes to zero.
